In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

1. How many orders were placed in January? 

SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM JanSales;

2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 

SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone';

3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 

SELECT acctnum
FROM customers cust
INNER JOIN FebSales
ON order_id = orderid;

4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

SELECT distinct product, price 
FROM JanSales 
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;

5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

SELECT sum(quantity)*price as revenue, product
FROM JanSales
GROUP BY product;

6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT sum(Quantity), product, sum(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM FebSales 
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 

SELECT count(customers.acctnum), AVG(quantity) * price
FROM FebSales
LEFT JOIN customers 
ON orderid = order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity > 2;

8. Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive?

SELECT DISTINCT location, COUNT(orderID)
FROM JanSales
WHERE location LIKE '%NY%'
GROUP BY location;

9. How many of each type of headphone was sold in February?

SELECT SUM(Quantity) as quantity, Product
FROM FebSales 
WHERE Product like '%Headphones%'
GROUP BY Product;

10. What was the average amount spent per account in February?

SELECT AVG(quantity*price)
FROM FebSales
LEFT JOIN customers
ON FebSales.orderid = customers.order_id;

11. What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February?

SELECT SUM(quantity) / COUNT(customers.acctnum)
FROM FebSales
LEFT JOIN customers
ON FebSales.orderid = customers.order_id;

12. Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total? 

SELECT product, SUM(quantity*price)
FROM JanSales 
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY SUM(quantity*price) DESC 
LIMIT 1
HAVING COUNT (orderID) > 2;
